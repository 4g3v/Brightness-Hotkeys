# Brightness-Hotkeys
## About
When this project was created I had a laptop, I watched videos on it every night. Pretty quickly I got annoyed by needing to turn off the brightness and starting a sleep timer. This is why this project got created, it adds three shortcuts (Shift+F5-7) to control the brightness, the last one dims the screen completely and starts a sleep timer.

## Disclaimer
I don't expect anyone to use this as is, but the code might serve as an example on how to control the screen's brightness in C#. At the time I couldn't find any examples on how to do this so I reverse engineered parts of the `Windows Mobility Center` to figure this out, so take it with a grain of salt.
